# Spam_SMS_Classification
Short Message Service or SMS is considered the text messaging service component of Telephone or Internet. In our day-to-day lives, we receive a considerable amount of SMS from Friends, Telecom, or Bank companies regarding our daily transactions or from many other sources. Some of these SMS texts are genuine whereas some can lead to fraudulent incidents.
We built a Machine Learning model using a classification model that can predict the SMS as HAM or SPAM with the help of the text body of the SMS. We used a dataset from Kaggle.
